keffmpeg is a tiny bat file, aimed at protecting windows users from the
command line. It is included in the teve source distribution until reencoding
functionality is implemented directly into teve.

Unlike teve, keffmpeg.bat will talk to you in Swedish only.


INSTALLATION

1. Get a static ffmpeg build:

     32-bit: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/
     64-bit: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/

   (You're looking for ffmpeg-latest-winXX-static.7z)

2. Open the archive and extract the file

     ffmpeg-git-HASH-win32-static\bin\ffmpeg.exe
   
   No other files are needed.

3. Put keffmpeg.bat and ffmpeg.exe in the same directory.


USAGE

Double click keffmpeg.bat. Do as the batch file tells you.
