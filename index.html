        <h3>What it is</h3>

<p>teve is a command line streamer and downloader for online TV sites, written in (Chicken) Scheme and usable as a stand alone binary, interpreted script, embedded library or as a backend for other scripts. The source is (copy)free and open under the ISC license.</p>

<p>Swedish users might want to visit the <a href="http://planka.huggpunkt.org/">Huggpunkt BB</a>.</p>

<h3>Why it is</h3>

<p>There are other programs and services which does similar things. The aim of this project differs from most others in several aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is compilable, portable and embeddable</li>
<li>It tries to behave like a unix tool (it has a command line interface, does the expected, is usable in scripts, does one thing well etc)</li>
<li>When available, it uses those other programs, scripts and services to support more sites and download protocols.</li>
</ul><h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Clone or download the source from the GitHub repo and open the included <a href="https://raw.github.com/simio/teve/master/README">README</a> file.</p>

<h3>How to contribute</h3>

<p>teve is developed on spare time. You are welcome to contribute through donations, coding, finding and reporting bugs, writing guides on how to use the program or documenting the workings of currently unsupported sites for later implementation into teve.</p>

<p>Further instructions on how to help will follow – later. For now, send an email to <a href="mailto:jesper@huggpunkt.org">jesper@huggpunkt.org</a> or visit the above mentioned BB to get in touch.</p>
