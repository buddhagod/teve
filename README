teve [te:ve:] is CLI streamer and downloader for online TV sites.
The name is derived from "tee video", which is one of the main points of
the program.

The current implementation (written for Chicken Scheme) is a prototype
and work in progress. The language used in the final implementation has
yet to be decided.

teve will replace SVTPlay.sh as soon as feature-by-feature compatiblity
is achieved. SVTPlay.sh is freely available from
https://github.com/simio/media-scripts, though it speaks Swedish.


1. REQUIREMENTS

Chicken Scheme is required to run and compile, preferably 4.7 or later.
If your package manager does not contain Chicken, or the latest version
is outdated, building from source is mind-numbingly simple on most
platforms.

The source is available from here:

	http://code.call-cc.org/

After installing Chicken, you'll also need to install a few eggs:

    $ chicken-install -s utf8 uri-common intarweb srfi-37 json \
          http-client vector-lib irregex


2. BUILDING

Just 'make' to get a binary, and then run it:

    $ ./teve -h

Optionally, teve can be interpreted like any script:

    $ csi -s teve.scm -h
