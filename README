teve [te:ve:] is a work-in-progress CLI streamer and downloader for
online TV sites. The name is derived from "tee video", which is one of
the main points of the program.

The current implementation (written in Scheme) is a prototype. Which
programming language the final implementation will use has yet to be
decided.

teve will replace SVTPlay.sh as soon as feature-by-feature compatiblity
is achieved. The script is freely available from this GitHub repo:

    https://github.com/simio/media-scripts

Please be aware that it will only talk you in Swedish.


1. REQUIREMENTS

Chicken Scheme is required to run and compile, preferably 4.7 or later.
If your package manager does not contain Chicken, or contains only an
outdated version, building it from source is mind-numbingly simple on
most platforms.

The source code is available from the Chicken home page:

	http://code.call-cc.org/

After installing Chicken, you'll also need to install a few eggs:

	# make install-eggs

Or if you'd like to see what you're installing:

	# make print-eggs
	utf8 intarweb srfi-37 json http-client vector-lib packrat ...
    # chicken-install $(make print-eggs)


2. BUILDING

Just 'make' to get a binary, and then run it:

    $ ./teve -h
    teve prototype-1
    Usage: teve [-hlv] [-d id] [-o outfile] url
      -d <id>   Download stream #<id>
      -h        Show this message.
      -l        List available streams.
      -o <file> Download to <file>. (Default is 'movie'.)
      -v        Be verbose.

If you would rather run teve as a script, that's fine too:

    $ csi -s teve.scm -h
